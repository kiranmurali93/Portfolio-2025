    "aboutBrief": "I’m a software engineer who thrives on building things that solve real-world problems — from side projects and open-source tools to scalable backend systems. \n I enjoy digging deep into systems, databases, and protocols, and I often find myself obsessing over clean architecture and developer experience. Whether it's a quirky browser extension or a fintech tool, I try to ship with clarity and purpose. \n My interests revolve around distributed systems, performance optimization, and learning by doing. I document my learnings through blogs that reflect both wins and war stories — the things that don’t usually make it to the README."
