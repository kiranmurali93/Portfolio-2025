# About

Scalperr is a mobile-first trading tool designed for options scalpers who need fast-execution features during high-volatility market conditions.

## Overview

I built a backend service using Golang that connects with broker APIs (like Zerodha, Angel One, etc.) to stream live market data, place quick trades, and manage positions. The tool is optimized for speed and responsiveness, making it suitable for traders looking to enter and exit positions within seconds.

## Technical Details

- **Technologies Used**: Golang, Postgres, Redis
- **Key Features**:

  Real-time option chain and price tracking

  Single-tap market and limit order placement

  Custom trigger-based trade execution

  Live position monitoring
  
  Broker integration with OAuth/token management
